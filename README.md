Taking up the walkroad to understand the Machine Learning concepts and algorithms.
This repository is for all projects that I've been working on and helpful resources that I used along the Journey.

## Projects Covered

|Sr|Project name| Description|
|--|------------|------------|
| 1.| [Titanic_challenge, Kaggle](./1.%20Titanic_challenge)|This challenge is about predicting the possibility of survival for the passengers in Titanic by using the dataset given and all details about the challenge can be found at [Kaggle_titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)|
|2|[Student Performance Kaggle](./2.%20Student%20%20Performance%20Kaggle)| Student Performance Prediction using Kaggle Dataset found here: [Kaggle Students](https://www.kaggle.com/larsen0966/student-performance-data-set)|
|3.|[Early stopping implementation](./3.%20Callbacks)|Used the [Keras Callbacks API](https://keras.io/api/callbacks/) to stop the neural network training everytime the needed model performance is reached and this can minimize the actual computing costs.|
|4.| [Simple Linear Regression](./4.%20Regression)|Using Sklearn to build a simple Linear Regression model.|
|5.|[Find-S Algorithm](./5.%20Find-S%20Algorithm/)| Implementing the find-s algorithm from Tom M. Mitchell Machine learning book in python.|
