[Titanic_challenge, Kaggle](https://github.com/hirwa-nshuti/my-ml-playground/tree/main/Titanic_challenge): 
This challenge is about predicting the possibility of survival for the passengers in Titanic 
by using the dataset given and all details about the challenge can be found at 
[Kaggle_titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

[MNIST Fashion Classifier](https://github.com/hirwa-nshuti/my-ml-playground/tree/main/MNIST%20Classifier):
A classification Algorithm using PyThorch and it is a project Submitted to Coursera as part of 
[IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer)

[Machine Learning with Python](https://github.com/hirwa-nshuti/my-ml-playground/tree/main/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Python):
A project for loan payback prediction submitted to coursera as part of 
[IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer)

[Regression with Keras](https://github.com/hirwa-nshuti/my-ml-playground/tree/main/Regression_with_keras):
Regresion models using Keras Submitted to coursera as part of 
[IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer)

[Student Performance Kaggle](https://github.com/hirwa-nshuti/my-ml-playground/tree/main/Student%20Performance%20Kaggle):
Student Performance Prediction using Kaggle Dataset found here: [Kaggle Students](https://www.kaggle.com/larsen0966/student-performance-data-set)

[Early stopping implementation](https://github.com/hirwa-nshuti/my-ml-playground/tree/main/Callbacks):
Used the [Keras Callbacks API](https://keras.io/api/callbacks/) to stop the neural network training everytime the needed 
model performance is reached and this can minimize the actual computing costs.
