# All Machine Learning

## Author: Felix

### Last Modified: 28-Feb-2022

Taking up the walkroad to understand the Machine Learning concepts and algorithms.
This repository is for all projects that I've been working on and helpful resources that I used along the Journey.

## Projects Covered

* [Titanic_challenge, Kaggle](https://github.com/hirwa-nshuti/my-ml-playground/tree/main/Titanic_challenge):
This challenge is about predicting the possibility of survival for the passengers in Titanic
by using the dataset given and all details about the challenge can be found at
[Kaggle_titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

* [Student Performance Kaggle](https://github.com/hirwa-nshuti/my-ml-playground/tree/main/Student%20Performance%20Kaggle):
Student Performance Prediction using Kaggle Dataset found here: [Kaggle Students](https://www.kaggle.com/larsen0966/student-performance-data-set)

* [Early stopping implementation](https://github.com/hirwa-nshuti/my-ml-playground/tree/main/Callbacks):
Used the [Keras Callbacks API](https://keras.io/api/callbacks/) to stop the neural network training everytime the needed
model performance is reached and this can minimize the actual computing costs.

* [Simple Linear Regression](https://github.com/hirwa-nshuti/my-ml-playground/tree/main/Regression): Using Sklearn to build ML models.
